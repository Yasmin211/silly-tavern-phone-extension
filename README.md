# Silly Tavern Phone Simulator Extension

An immersive phone simulator plugin for [SillyTavern](https://sillytavern.app/). It renders specific instructions generated by the language model (LLM) into a feature-rich smartphone interface in real-time, greatly enhancing the interactivity and realism of role-playing.

Many UI design elements were inspired by Duoyunxiong's phone plugin. Thanks to open source. Therefore, this phone is also allowed to be modified. Just be sure to link back to the original post.

**Core Highlights ✨**
📱 **Multi-app Ecosystem:** This isn't just an app, it's a whole phone!

*   **WeChat & Social:** Experience realistic private and group chats with typing animations and rich message types (images, voice messages, transfers, red packets, locations), and even a fully functional Moments feed where you can like and comment!
*   **Browser:** A truly usable web browser! The AI can dynamically generate search results and full web page content for you to explore in your story. Of course, history and bookmark functions are also included.
*   **Forum:** A built-in classic BBS-style forum to provide a deeper platform for your world-building and character interactions.
*   ...and the essential **Phone & Email** functions!

🚀 **Extremely Smooth, Excellent Performance:** We've equipped the chat interface with virtual scrolling technology, ensuring silky-smooth scrolling even with hundreds or thousands of message histories. Switching between apps also has exquisite native-level transition animations.

🎨 **Highly Customizable:** Customize your home screen, chat background wallpapers with your favorite pictures, and even set your own player avatar.

💾 **Persistent World:** All data—from contacts to chat records, to Moments posts—is safely stored in your character's world book, making this phone a real, memorable part of your story.

## 📦 Installation Guide
Phone Extension Link:
https://github.com/Yasmin211/silly-tavern-phone-extension

Tavern Assistant Link (must be installed):
https://github.com/N0VI028/JS-Slash-Runner

In the extension settings, find "Phone Simulator 📱" and make sure it is enabled.

## 🤖 AI Integration (Important!)

The operation of this plugin **completely depends on the AI strictly adhering to the predefined output formats**. These formats are like an "API contract" between the front end and the AI. Any output that deviates from the format will cause the plugin to fail to parse and render correctly.

Make sure the phone rules world book is loaded globally, and the rule format entries inside are correctly enabled.
After the update, the phone will create and bind the data world book by itself.

World Book Link: [Phone-Rules.json](Phone-Rules.json)

It is best to keep the contact entries in the world book enabled. This does not consume many tokens and helps the AI know who your WeChat friends and group chat members are.

## 🛠️ Architecture and Development

This project uses a modern front-end architecture.

We welcome community contributions! It is now very easy to develop an app within it and customize your favorite styles.

### Development Roadmap
*   Add the next video platform app.
*   Further polish the existing apps, especially chat, adding features like stickers and sending local images.
*   ||Actually, the sticker function should be usable. As long as you pull the stickers from other phone plugins into this world book, and then explain it in the chat rules, the current image hosting only supports catbox, please check carefully.||

### Possible bugs 🐛 and things you must not do 🚫
**World Book Data Corruption**
*   **Scenario:** The user, out of curiosity or by mistake, manually edits a world book entry (e.g., `PhoneSimulator_ChatHistory`) and corrupts its JSON structure.
*   **Risk:** When the plugin starts or refreshes data, `JSON.parse()` in the `fetch*.js` module will fail, which may cause the entire application's data to fail to load, or even result in a blank screen.
